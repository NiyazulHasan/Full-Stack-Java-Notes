Programming language
=====================
A language which is used to communicate between user and computer is called 
programming language.

Programming language acts like meditor or interface between user and computer.

Diagram: introduction2

Programming language divided into two types.

1)Low Level Language

2)High Level Language


1)Low Level Language
------------------------
A language which is understand by a computer easily is called low level language.

In general, a language which is computer dependent is called low level language.

ex:
	Machine language
	Assembly language 


Machine language
-----------------
It is a fundamental language of a computer which is combination of 0's and 1's.

It is also known as binary language.

A computer may understand many languages but to understand machine language computer does not required any translator.

Advantages:

	> A program writtens in machine language consumes less memory.
	> It does not required any translator.
	> It is more efficient when compare to other languages.

Disadvantages:
	> It is a burdun on a programmer to remember donzen's of binary code.
	> If anywhere error raised in our program then locating and handling that 
	  error becomes more difficult.
	> Modifications can't be done easily.


Assembly language 
------------------
The second generation language came into an existence is called assembly language.

It is a replacement of symbols and letters for mathematical programming code i.e opcode values (JUMP,AVG and etc).

It is also known as symbolic language.

Assembly language can't understand by a computer directly.We required translator.

We have three types of translators.

1)Assembler

2)Compiler

3)Interpreter 

1)Assembler
--------------
It is one of the translator which converts assemblic code to machine code.

Merits:
	> If anywhere error raised in our program then locating and handling 
	  that error is easy.

	> Modifications can be done easily.

Demerits:
	
	> It is a mintrick to remember all symbolic code.

	> It requires translator.

	> It is less efficient when compare to machine language.



Q)What is Debugging?

Error is also known as Bug.

The process of eliminating the bugs from the application is called debugging.


2)High Level Language
======================
A language which is understand by a user easily is called high level language.

In general , a language which is user dependent is called high level language.
ex:
	Java, .Net , Python , Perl , GoLang and etc.

High level language can't understand by a computer directly.We required translators.

compiler
----------
	It is used to compile and execute our program at a time.

interpreter 
------------
	It is used to execute our program line by line procedure.


Advantages:
	
	> It is easy to learn and easy to use because it is similar to engligh lang.

	> Debugging can be done easily.

	> Modifications can be done easily.

Disadvantages:

	> It require translators.

	> A program writtens in high level language consumes huge amount of memory.

	> It not efficient when compare to low level language.

Project
==========
It an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim or goal.

A project is a collection of modules.
ex:
	admin module
	registration module
	logic module
	add to cart module
	report generating module 
	and etc.

Every project contains two domains.

1)Technical Domain 
----------------
	It describes what language we have used to develop the project.
	ex:
		Java

2)Functional Domain 
---------------------
	It describes state of a project.
	ex:
		Healthcare domain
		Banking domain 
		Insaurance domain
		ERP domain 
		and etc.

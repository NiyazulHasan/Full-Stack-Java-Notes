object
======
Object is an outcome of a blue print.

It is a instance of a class.

Here instance means allocating memory for our data members.

Memory space will be created when we create an object.

We can create object as follow.

syntax:
	Class_name   reference_variable=new Constructor();
ex:
	Test   t = new  Test();

It is possible to create more then one object in a single class.

ex:
class Test 
{
	public static void main(String[] args) 
	{
		Test t1=new Test();
		Test t2=new Test();
		Test t3=new Test();
		
		System.out.println(t1.hashCode());
		System.out.println(t2.hashCode());
		System.out.println(t3.hashCode());

		System.out.println(t1);//Test@Hexadecimal 
		System.out.println(t2.toString());//Test@Hexadecimal 
		System.out.println(t3.toString());//Test@Hexadecimal 
	}
}


hashCode()
===========
It is a method present in Object class.

For every object, JVM will create a unique identification number i.e hash code.

In order to read hash code we need to use hashCode() method.

Diagram: java28.1


toString()
============
It is a method present in Object class.

Whenever we are trying to display any object reference directly or indirectly toString() method will be executed.


Data Hiding
==============
It is used to hide the data from the outsider.

It means outside person must not access our data directly.

Using private modifier we can implement data hiding concept.

ex:
	class  Account
	{
		private double balance;
		-
		-
	}


Object class
==============
Object class present in java.lang package.

Object class consider as a parent class for every java program.

Object class contains following methods.

ex:
	cmd> javap   java.lang.Object 	

	getClass()
	clone()
	finalize()
	equals()
	hashCode()
	toString()
	notify()
	notifyAll()
	wait()
	and etc.

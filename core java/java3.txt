History of Java
=================
In 1990, Sun micro system company has taken one project to develop a software called consumer electronic device which can be controlled by a remote like setup box.That time project was called stealth project and later it was renamed to green project.

James Gosling, Mike Sheradin and Patrick Naughton were there to develop this project.
They met in a place called Aspan/Colarado to start the work with graphic system.James Gosling decided to use C and C++ languages developed that project.But problem what they have faced is C and C++ language are system dependent.Then James Gosling decided why don't we create our own programming language? which is system independent.

In 1991, they have developed one programming language called an OAK.OAK means strength , itself is a coffee seed name and it is a national tree for many contries like Germany , France , USA and etc.

Later in 1995, they have renamed OAK to JAVA. JAVA is a island of an Indonasia where first coffee of seed was produced.During the development of project they were consuming lot of coffee's that why symbol of java is a cup of coffee with saucer.

Naming Convention in java
==========================
In java uppercase letters will consider as different and lower case letter will consider as different thats why we consider java is a case sensitive programming language.

As java is a case sensitive, we must and should follow naming conventions for following things.
ex:
	classes
	interfaces
	variables
	methods
	keywords
	packages
	constants 

classes
-----------
In java,A class must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	Predefined class		Userdefined class
	----------------		------------------
	System 				Test
	FileWriter			TestApp
	BufferedReader			IhubTalent
	Scanner 

interfaces
-----------
In java,An interface must and should starts with uppercase letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	Predefined interface		Userdefined interface
	-----------------		-----------------------
	Runnable			ITest
	Serializable			IExample
	ListIterator			IIhubTalent
	Enumeration 
	and etc.

variables
----------
In java, a variable name must and should starts with lower case letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.

ex:
	predefined variables		userdefined variables
	----------------		--------------------
	length				i
	out				a
	err				empId
	in 				studName 
	and etc.


methods
----------
In java, a method name must and should starts with lower case letter and if it contains multiple words then each inner word must starts with initcap.
ex:
	predefined methods		userdefined methods
	------------------		-------------------
	getPriority()			m1()
	hashCode()			getEmployeeDetails()
	getClass()			setInfo()
	setName()			calculateBillAmount()
	and etc.

keywords
==========
In java ,all keywords we need to write under lowercase letters.

ex:
	predefined keywords
	-----------------
	public 
	static
	void
	if
	for 
	else
	and etc.

packages
-----------
In java, all packages we need to write under lower case letters.
ex:
	predefined packages		userdefined packages
	-----------------		------------------
	java.lang			manohar 
	java.io				com.manohar.www
	java.util			com.ihub.www
	java.text
	java.time
	javax.servlet
	javax.jsp 
	and etc.

constants
-----------
In java, all constants we need to write under uppercase letters.

ex:
	predefined constants
	--------------------
	MAX_PRIORITY
	NORM_PRIORITY
	MIN_PRIOROITY
	MAX_VALUE
	MIN_VALUE

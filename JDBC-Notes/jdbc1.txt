JDBC
=====
As if now it is known as trademark.

But earlier it is known as Java Database Connectivity.

RAM is a temperory storage device or medium.

During the program execution our data will store in RAM.

Once the program execution is completed we will loss the data.

To overcome this limitation we are making our applications writing the data into the files or database softwares.

Files and Database softwares act like a permanent storage device or medium.

Persistence
-------------
The process of storing and managing the data for a long period of time is called persistence.


import terminologies
=====================

persistence store 
----------------
It is a place where we can store and manage the data for a long period of time.
ex:
	Files and Database software's.


persistence data 
-----------------
Data of a persistence store is called persistence data.
ex:
	Records 
	tables 

persistence operation
-----------------------
Insert,Update,Delete,Create and Select are called persistence operations.

In realtime this operation is also known as CURD operation,CRUD operation or SCUD operation.
ex:
	C - Create	S - Select
	U - Update 	C - Create
	R - Read 	U - Update
	D - Delete 	D - Delete 
 

persistence logic 
--------------------
A logic which is capable to perform persitence operations is called persistence logic.
ex:
	JDBC code 
	Hibernate code 
	Ibatis code 
	IOStream 
	
persistence technology 
--------------------
A technology which is used to develop persistence logic is called persistence technology.
ex:
	JDBC
	Hibernate
	JPA
	and etc.


Q)What is JDBC?

JDBC is a persistence technology which is used to develop persistence logic having the capability to perform persistence operations on persistence data of a persistence store.

Note:
-----
			    IOStream 
	JavaApp	--------------------------------  Files
		  Serialization/Deserialization


			  JDBC Code 
	JavaApp	--------------------------------  DB s/w

Serialization
================
The process of converting from one state to another state is called serialization.

In general , process of converting object state to file state is called serialization.

In serialization ,object will not store in a file.Object data will store in a file.

Diagram: jdbc1.1


Deserialization
===============
The process of taking the data from the file and representing an object is called
deserialization.

In general , process of converting file state to object state is called Deserialization.

Diagram: jdbc1.2

Limitations with file as persistence store
==========================================
> We can store limited amount of data.

> There is no security.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is not possible.

> It does not show an application with relationships (1-1,1-m,m-2,m-m).

> It does not allows us to apply constraints (not null,unique,primary key,foreign   key, check).

> Updation and Deletion of data can't be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can't be done easily.


Advantages of database as persistence store
============================================
> We can store unlimited amount of data.

> There is a security.

> It supports common query language.

> Fetching the data with multiple conditions is possible.

> It shows an application with relationships.

> It allows us to apply constraints.

> Updation and Deletion of data can be done directly.

> Merging and comparision of data can be done easily.

 
Every JDBC application is a two-tier application.Where java with JDBC code acts like a frontend/tier1/layer1 and database software acts like a backend/tier2/layer2.

The one which is visible to the enduser to perform some operations is called frontend.

The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs some operations based on the instructions given by frontend is called backend.

Enduser is a non-technical person,They can't prepare and execute SQL query in database software.They depends upon frontend developers having the capability to do that work them.

JDBC Driver
===========
JDBC driver acts like a bridge between java application and database software.

IT is used to converts java calls to database calls and vice versa.

Here calls means instructions.

Diagram: jdbc1.4


ODBC Driver
===========
Perl,VB2,D2k and etc uses ODBC drivers to locate and communicate with database software.
 
Diagram: jdbc1.5

ODBC drivers developed in c langauge by taking the support of pointers. 
But java does not support pointers.To overcome this limitation sun micro system 
company introduced JDBC drivers exclusively. 

We will get JDBC software from three parties.

1)Sun micro system  company (creator of jdbc driver)

2)Database vendor 

3)Third party vendor 


We will get ODBC software from three parties.

1)Xopen company (creator of ODBC driver)

2)Database vendor 

3)Third party vendor 

Q)How many drivers are there in jdbc?

We have four types of JDBC drivers.

1)Type1 JDBC driver (JDBC-ODBC bridge driver /partly java driver)

2)Type2 JDBC driver (Native API / partly java driver)

3)Type3 JDBC driver (Net Protocol / Java Driver)

4)Type4 JDBC driver (Native Protocol / Java Driver)


To use any JDBC driver we need to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

Every jdbc application contains one built-in service called DriverManager service.

This service we can achieve by using DriverManager class.

Class.forName()
==================
It is always recommanded to use Class.forName() method to register JDBC driver with DriverManager service.

It is used to load the driver class but it won't create an object.

ex:
	Class.forName("driver-class-name");


Connection object
=================
Connection is an interface which is present java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Connection interface.

To perform any operation in a database we required Connection object.

Once the work with database is completed we need to close the Connection object.


DriverManager.getConnection()
===============================
It is a static method present in DriverManager class.

It is used to connect with database and return one JDBC Connection object representing connectivity between java application and database software.

ex:
	Connection con=DriverManager.getConnection("driver-url","uname","pwd");


Statement object
=================
Statement is an interface which is present in java.sql package.

It is an object of underlying supplied java class which implements java.sql.Statement interface.

It acts like a vehicle between java application and database software.

It is used to sends and executes SQL query in database software.

Statement object we can create by using createStatement() method of Connection object.
ex:
	Statement st=con.createStatement();

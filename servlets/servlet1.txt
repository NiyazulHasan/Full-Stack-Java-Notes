What is Web application
========================
A web application is a collection of web resource programs having the capability to generate web pages.

We have two types of web pages.

1)static web page / passive web page

2)Dynamic web page / Active web page

1)static web page / passive web page
------------------------------------
A webpage with fixed content is called static web page.
ex:
	home page
	aboutus page
	contactus page
	services page 
	and etc.

2)Dynamic web page / Active web page
-------------------------------------
A web page with no fixed content is called dynamic web page.
ex:
	gmail inbox page
	stock market share value page
	live cricket score page 
	and etc.


We have two types of web resource programs.

1)Static web resource program
--------------------------
Static web resource program is used to generate static web pages.
ex:
	HTML program
	CSS program
	bootstrap program
	angularjs program 
	and etc.
	
2)Dynamic web resource program
------------------------------
Dynamic web resource program is used to generate dynamic web pages.
ex:
	servlet program
	jsp program 
	and etc.

Based onthe position and execution these web resource programs categories into 
two types.

1)Client side web resource program
------------------------------
A web  resource program which execute at client side is called client side web resource program.

All static web resource programs are called client side web resource programs.
ex:
	html program,
	css program,
	bootstrap progra,
	angularjs program
	and etc.

2)Server side web resource program 
----------------------------------
A web resource program which execute at server side is called server side web resource program.

All dynamic web resource programs are called server side web resource program.

ex:
	servlet program,
	jsp program 
	and etc.


Setup of web application and web resource program execution
===============================================================

Java application will execute manually.

Web application and web resource programs are executed at the time when they have requested.

Diagram : servlet1.1


With respect to the diagram
--------------------------------
1)Enduser will give the request to web resource program.

2)Web server will trap that request and pass the request to appropriate web resource 
  program.

3)Web resource program will execute the logic to process the request.

4)Web resource program will communicate with database software if necessary.

5)Web resource program gives the output to web server.

6)Web server will send the output to browser window as dynamic response.

Note:
------
The process of keeping the web application into a server is called deployment and reverse is called undeployment.


Web server
=============
A web server is a piece of software which is used to automate whole process of 
web application and web resource program execution.

ex:
	Tomcat, Resin,Jboss,Glassfish,wildfly and etc.


Responsibilities of a web server
-------------------------------
1) It takes continious request from client.

2) It will pass the request to appropriate web resource program.

3) It provides environment to deploy and undeploy the web applications.

4) It allows to execute client side web resource programs at browser window.

5) It will add middleware services only to deployed web application.

6) It gives the output to browser window as dynamic response.

7) It is used to automate whole process of web application and web resource program 
   execution.


To execute java program we required JRE/JVM.

To execute Applet we required Applet viewer or Applet container.

To execute servlet program we required servlet container.

To execute jsp program we required jsp container.

Web container
=================
A web container is a software application or a program which is used to manage whole life cycle of web resource programs (from birth to deadth).

Servlet container manage whole life cycle of servlet program.

Similarly , jsp container manage whole life cycle of jsp program.

Some part of industry consider servlet container and jsp container are 
web containers.

Tomcat
===========
Version		:	7.x

company		:	Apache foundation  

Port No		:	8080

Creator		:	David Duncanson

website		:	www.apache.org

documents	:	www.doc.apache.org

servlet container:   	Catalina

JSP container	:	Jasper

Before 1.6 version tomcat is know as web server.
But from 1.6 version onwards tomcat is also known as application server.

Tomcat is not a container . It is a server containing servlet container and jsp container.

Tomcat installation will ask four things.

1)Port No 

2)Adminstrator username and password 

3)JRE location (parallel to jdk)

4)Tomcat installation location 



Installation of Tomcat 7.x server
-----------------------------------
Right click to tomcat software -->  yes  --> Next --> I Agree  -->  select Full -->

Next --> Http Connector port No : 2525  ---> 
	 Adminatration username : admin
	               password : admin  ---> Next  --->  Next  --> click to Browse button 

-->E:\Tomcat7.0 ----> Install .
			
	
Steps to convert Tomcat automatic startup type to manual startup type
--------------------------------------------------------------------
services (view local services) --> Apache Tomcat 7.x   --> click to stop link -->

double click to Apache Tomcat 7.x  --> startup type --> Manual ---> Apply --> ok.




Q)What is Servlet?
====================
Servlet is a java based web resource program which enhance the functionality of web server and application server.

or

Servlet is a java based web resource program which is used to generate dynamic web pages.

or

Servlet is a single instance multithread java based web resource program which is used to develop web applications.

Diagram: servlet1.2


Servlet API
============
API is a collection of packages.
ex:
	javax.servlet 
	javax.servlet.http 



Import Resources of servlet
===========================
javax.servlet.Servlet (I)
	|
	|
javax.servlet.GenericServlet(AC)
	|
	|
javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet(C)

Pattern matching opeators
===========================
Pattern matching operators are used to select the letters from database table.

We have two types of pattern matching operators.

1)Percentage (%)

2)Underscore (_)

Pattern matching operators will take the support of like keyword.

1)Percentage (%)
------------------
Q)Write a query to display all the employees information whose name starts with 'A' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like 'A%';


Q)Write a query to display all the employees information whose name ends with 'n' letter?

	select * from emp where ename like '%n';

Q)Write a query to display all the employees information whose name having middle letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%l%';	


2)Underscore (_)
-----------------
Q)Write a java program to display employees information whose employee name having 
second letter as 'l'?

	select * from emp where ename like '_l%';


Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee name having second last letter as 'r'?

	select * from emp where ename like '%r_';


Q)write a query to display employees information whose employee name having third letter as 's'?

	select * from emp where ename like '__s%';

DDL commands
=============
create    - (tables)
alter	  - (columns)	
drop	  - (tables)	
truncate  - (rows/records)
rename    - (tables)


alter command
-------------
Using alter command we can perform following activities very easily.

i)Adding a new column

ii)Droping a existing column

iii)Modifying a column

iv)Renaming a column 

i)Adding a new column
-----------------------
Using alter command we can add new column in a existing table.
syntax:
	alter table <table_name> ADD (col1 datatype(size));

ex:
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10));
	alter table student ADD (pincode number(8));
	alter table student ADD (state varchar2(10),pincode number(8));
	
	update student set state='Telangana' where sno=101;


ii)Droping a existing column
----------------------------
Using alter command we can drop a existing column.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> DROP (col_name);
ex:
	alter table student DROP (state,pincode);


iii)Modifying a column
----------------------
Using alter command we can modify a column.

We can change size of a column only if existing values are fit into new size.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> modify (col datatype(size));

ex:
	desc student;	

	alter table student MODIFY (sadd varchar2(14));

	desc student;


We can change the datatype of a column only if that column is empty.
ex:
	alter table student modify (sadd number(14));


iv)Renaming a column 
----------------------
Using alter command we can rename a column name.

syntax:
	alter table <table_name> rename  column <old_name> to <new_name>;

ex:
	alter table student rename column sadd to city;

	alter table emp rename column esal to dailywages;

	alter table emp rename column job to designation;


drop command
-------------
It is used to drop the table permanently from database table.

syntax:
	drop table <table_name>;
ex:
	drop table emp;
	drop table dept;
	drop table student;



truncate  command
-------------------
It is used to delete the records permenently from database table.

syntax:

	truncate table <table_name>;
ex:
	truncate table student;
	truncate table dept;
	truncate table emp;
 
Q)What is the difference between delete and truncate command?

delete					truncate 
-----------				----------
It will delete the records temperorly.	It will delete the records permanently.

We can rollback the data.		We can't rollback the data.

Where clause can be used.		Where clause can't be used.


rename  command
--------------
It is used to rename the table name.

syntax:
	rename <old_name> to <new_name>;
ex:
	rename student to students;
	rename emp to employees;
	rename dept to departments;


Duplicate table or Copy of a table
==================================
Using create and select command we can create duplicate or copy of a table.

ex:
	drop table stud;

	create table stud as select * from emp;

	create table stud as select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	create table stud as select * from emp where deptno=10;

	create table stud as select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203);

	create table stud as select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	create table stud as select * from emp where ename like 'A%';

	create table stud as select * from emp where NOT job='Manager';

	create table stud as select * from emp where comm is null;


cl scr
======
It is used to clear the output screen of SQL command prompt.

syntax:
	cl  scr


Functions
==============
Functions are used to manipulate the data items and give the results.

We have two types of functions in SQL.

1)Group Functions / Multiple Rows Functions 

2)Scalar Functions / Single Row Functions 


1)Group Functions
-------------------
Group functions are applicable for multiple rows.

We have following list of group functions.

ex:
	sum(), avg(), max(), min(), count() and count(expression).


Q)Write a query to  display sum of salary of each employee?

	select  sum(esal) from emp;

	

Q)Write a query to display average salary of each employee?
	
	select avg(esal) from emp;



Q)Write a query to display highest salary from emp table?

	select max(esal) from emp;


Q)Write a query to display  least salary from emp table?

	select min(esal) from emp;


Q)Write a query to display number of records present in database table?

	select count(*) from emp;


Q)What is the difference between count(*) and count(expression)?

count(*)				
------------------			
It will return number of records present in database table.
It will include null records.
ex:
	select count(*) from emp;//6 records 


count(expression)
----------------
It will return number of values present in a database table column.
It will not include null values.
ex:
	select count(eid) from emp; // 6 

	select count(comm) from emp; // 5

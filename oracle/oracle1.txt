Types of Data
===============
We have two types of data.

1)Unstructured data

2)Structured data

1)Unstructured data
------------------
Data which is not in readable format is called unstructured data.
In general, meaningless data is called unstructured data.
ex:
	302  Willoro   lakemba   syd    nsw

2)Structured data
----------------
Data which is in readable format is called structured data.
In general, meaningfull data is called structured data.
ex:
	unit  street   locality  city   state
	----  ------   --------  ----  ------
	302  Willoro   lakemba   syd    nsw

Oracle
=========
Oracle is one of the database which is used to store structured data.

Oracle is a product of oracle corporation.

Oracle is divided into two types.

				Oracle
	|--------------------------|----------------------|	
	SQL						PL/SQL
(Structured Query Language)			(Procedural Language/Structured
						Query Language)


Client/Server architecture
============================
In this architecture we will see how our data will store from frontend to backend.

Diagram: oracle1.1

FrontEnd
--------
The one which is visible to the enduser to use the system is called frontend.
ex:
	Java,.Net,Python,Perl,D2K and etc.

Communication Channel
-------------------
It acts like a bridge between frontend and backend.
ex:
	JDBC - Java Database connectivity
	ODBC - Open Database connectivity
	PDBC - Python Database connectivity.

BackEnd
--------
The one which is not visible to the enduser but it performs some operations based on the instructions given by fontend is called backend.
ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL server, PostgreSQL, mongodb and etc.



Management system
===================
Management system is a software which is used to manage the database.

Management system will perform following acitivities very easy.

1)Adding a new data

2)Modifying a existing data

3)Deleting a unnecessary data

4)Selecting a required data 

DBMS
==========
A database along with software which is used to manage the database is called database management system.

RDBMS
========
If a database is created based on relational theories such type of database is called relational database management.

ex:
	Oracle, MySQL, SQL server, PostgreSQL,sybase, teradata ,DB2 and etc


SQL
======
SQL stands for structured query language which is pronounce as SEQUEL.

This language is used to communicate with oracle database.

It is a case insensitive language.

It is a command based language.

Every command must starts with verb.
ex:
	select,insert,update,delete and etc.

Every command must and should ends with semicolon(;).	

It is developed by Mr.Codd in 1972, by IBM.


Sub languages of SQL
=====================
We have five sub languages of SQL.

1)DDL (Data Definition Language)

2)DML (Data Manipulation Language)

3)DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)

4)TCL (Transaction Control Language)

5)DCL  (Data Control Language)


1)DDL (Data Definition Language)
-------------------------------
It is used to maintain the objects in database.
It is a collection of five commands.
ex:
	create,alter,drop,truncate and rename.


2)DML (Data Manipulation Language)
------------------------------------
It is used to manipulate the data present in database.
It is a collection of four commands.
ex:
	insert,update,delete,merge


3)DRL/DQL (Data Retrieve/Query Language)
------------------------------------
It is used to retrieve the data present in database.
It is a collection of one command.
ex:
	select 


4)TCL (Transaction Control Language)
--------------------------------
This language is used to maintain the transaction of database.
It is a collection of three commands.
ex:
	commit,rollback and savepoint.


5)DCL  (Data Control Language)
-----------------------------
It is used to control the access of data to the user.
It is a collection of two commands.
ex:
	grant and revoke .

Oracle
=======
version		:	10g or 11g

vendor		:	Oracle Corporation 

Creator		:	Mr. Codd

Open source	:	Open source

software	:	Express Edition 

website		:	www.oracle.com


username	:    	system (default)

password	:	admin

Establish the connection with database
===================================
If we want to perform any operation in a database we need to connect with the database.Once the work with database is completed then we need to disconnect  with database.

ex:1
-----
SQL> connect 
username :  system
password :  admin 

SQL> disconnect 


ex:2
-----
SQL> conn
username :  system
password :  admin 

SQL> disc 

ex:3
----
SQL> conn  system/admin 
SQL> disc 


Q)What is table
================
Table is a an object which is used to represent the data.

Table is a collection of rows and columns.

ex:
	-----------------------
	SNO	| SNAME	| SADD
	-----------------------
	101	| Alan	| USA
	-----------------------
	102	| Jose	| UAE
	-----------------------
	103	| James	| UK
	------------------------
	Here we have four rows and 3 columns.

Oracle is a case insensitive language.
But data which we stored in a table is a case sensitive.


create command
================
It is used to create a table in a database.

syntax:
	create table <table_name>(col1 datatype(size), col2 datatype(size),...,
						colN datatype(size));

ex:
	create table student(sno number(3), sname varchar2(10),
						sadd varchar2(12));

	create table dept(deptno number(3), dname varchar2(10),
						dloc varchar2(12));


	create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
			  deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(5));



Describe command
================
It is used to see the structure of the table.
syntax:
	desc <table_name>;
ex:
	desc emp;
	desc student;
	desc dept;



insert command
================
It is used to insert the records in a database table.

syntax:
	insert into <table_name> values(val1,val2,..,valN);
ex:
	insert into student values(101,raja,hyd); //invalid

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values('ravi',102,'delhi');// invalid 

	insert into student values(102,'ravi');// invalid 


null
-------
	null is used to represent undefined or unavailable.
	ex:

	insert into student values(102,'ravi',null);

approach2
--------
	insert into student(sno,sname,sadd) values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	insert into student(sno,sadd) values(104,'pune');

approach3
---------
	Using '&' symbol we can read dynamic inputs.

	insert into student values(&sno,'&sname','&sadd');


commit command
=================
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.
ex:
	commit;


dept table
==========
create table dept(deptno number(3), 
		     dname varchar2(10),
			dloc varchar2(12));

insert into dept values(10,'ECE','HYD');
insert into dept values(20,'EEE','PUNE');
insert into dept values(30,'MEC','DELHI');
insert into dept values(40,'CSE','CHENNAI');
commit;


emp table
===========
create table emp(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2),
			  deptno number(3),job varchar2(10),comm number(5));

insert into emp values(201,'Alan',9000,10,'Clerk',null);
insert into emp values(202,'Linda',18000,10,'Clerk',100);

insert into emp values(203,'Jose',29000,20,'HR',200);
insert into emp values(204,'Kelvin',34000,20,'HR',500);

insert into emp values(205,'Lisa',19000,30,'Manager',500);
insert into emp values(206,'Mark',17000,30,'Manager',900);

commit;

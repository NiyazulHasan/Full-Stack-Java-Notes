select command
===============
It is used to retrieve the data from database.

syntax:
	select * from <table_name>;

ex:
	select * from student;
	select * from emp;
	select * from dept;

	Here '*' means all rows and columns.


Projection
------------
Selecting specific columns from the database table is called projection.
ex:
	select * from student;
	select sno,sname,sadd from student;
	select sno from student;
	student sname from student;
	student sadd from student;


Column alias
---------------
A userdefined heading given to a column is called column alias.

Column alias is temperory.

Once the query is executed we will loss the column alias.

Column alias can applied to any column.

ex:
	select  sno as ROLL_NO,
		  sname as FIRST_NAME, 
		    sadd as CITY  
			from student; 

Arithmetic operations
-----------------------
In select command we can perform arithmetic operations also.
ex:
	select sno+100,sname,sadd from student;
	select sno-100,sname,sadd from student;
	select sno-100 as SNO,sname,sadd from student;

Logical Operators
====================
If we want to declare more then one condition in a query then we need to use logical operators.

We have three logical operators.

1)AND

2)OR

3)NOT 

1)AND
--------
It will return/retrieve the records if all conditions are true.

Here conditions must be from same row only.Otherwise we won't get any output.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 and ename='Alan'; 

	select * from emp where eid=201 and ename='Jose'; //no rows selected


2)OR
-------
It will return/retrieve the records if and if one condition is true.

Here conditions can be from any row.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Alan'; 

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR ename='Jose';

3)NOT 
-------
It will return/retrieve the records except the condition.

Here '<>' symbol denoted as not operator.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid=201;

	select * from emp where NOT eid=201;

	select * from emp where eid<>201;


Interview Queries
------------------
Q)Write a query to display employees information whose employee id is 201,202,203?

	select * from emp where eid=201 OR eid=202 OR eid=203;



Q)Write a query to display employees information whose salary is greater then 
  20000 and less then 40000?

	select * from emp where esal>20000 and esal<40000;
	

Q)Write a query to display employees information those who are not working in 10 department?

	select * from emp where NOT deptno=10;

	select * from emp where deptno<>10;


between operator
--------------------
It is used to display the records those who are matching in the range of values.

Between operator will take the support of AND operator.

In between operator , first we need to write lower limit then upper limit.

ex:
	select * from emp where eid between 201 AND 206;

	select * from emp where esal between 10000 AND 40000;

In operator
--------------
It will display the records those who are matching in the list of values.
In operator is a replacement of OR operator.
ex:
	select * from emp where eid IN(201,202,203,209);

	select * from emp where ename IN('Alan','Jose','Kane');

TCL commands
=============
We have three commands in TCL.

1)commit

2)rollback

3)savepoint 

1)commit
---------
It is used to make the changes permanent to database.
ex:
	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	select * from student; // 3 records selected 

	commit;

	select * from student; // 3 records selected 


rollback
-----------
It is used to undo the changes which are not permanent.

ex:
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	commit;

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','pune');

	select * from student; // 4 records selected 

	rollback;

	select * from student; // 2 records selected

3)savepoint
-------------
It is used to mark the logical transaction in a table.

Instead of complete rollback we can rollback upto savepoint. 

syntax:
------
	savepoint <savepoint_name>;
ex:
----
	drop table student;

	create table student(sno number(3),sname varchar2(10),sadd varchar2(12));

	insert into student values(101,'raja','hyd');

	insert into student values(102,'ravi','delhi');

	savepoint sp1;

	insert into student values(103,'ramana','vizag');

	insert into student values(104,'ramulu','pune');

	savepoint sp2;

	insert into student values(105,'raj','goa');

	insert into student values(106,'rakesh','mumbai');

	select * from student; // 6 records selected

	rollback to sp2;

	select * from student; // 4 records selected


PSEUDO columns
================
PSEUDO column means a column which is not real.

We have two pseudo columns.

1)ROWNUM

2)ROWID 

1)ROWNUM
----------
ROWNUM always start with 1 and increment by 1.

ROWNUM values are temperory.Once the query is executed we will loss the rownum values.

ex:
	select eid,ename,esal from emp;

	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;

	select rownum,sno,sname,sadd from student;


2)ROWID
--------
ROWID contains hexadecimal value.

ROWID values are permanent.

ROWID is a memory address where our records will store in a database table.

ex:
	select rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;
	select rowid,rownum,eid,ename,esal from emp;


Interview queries
-------------------

Q)Write a query to display first three records from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum<=3;



Q)Write a query to display 4 record from emp table?

	select * from emp where rownum=4; //no rows selected 

	
	select * from emp where rownum<=4
	minus
	select * from emp where rownum<=3;


DCL commands
============
We have two type of DCL commands.

1)grant 

2)revoke 


schema
------
	Schema is a memory location which is used to run SQL commands.

Privileges
------------
	Permissions given to a user is called privileges.

	In general, rights given to a user is called privileges.

	We have two types of privileges.

	1)System privilege : Permissions given by DBA to user.

	2)Object privilege : Permissions given by one developer to another.


1)grant 
--------
It is used to grant the permissions to ther user.

syntax:

	grant <privilege1>,<privilege2> to user;

2)revoke
----------
It is used to revoke the permissions from user.

syntax:

	revoke <privilege1>,<privilege2> from user;


DBA> create user suresh identified by suresh;
DBA> create user laxmi identified by laxmi;

suresh> conn  suresh/suresh  //logon denied 

laxmi > conn   laxmi/laxmi  //logon denied 

DBA> grant  resource,connect to suresh;
DBA> grant  resource,connect to laxmi;
DBA> grant  resource,connect to suresh,laxmi;

suresh> conn  suresh/suresh  

laxmi > conn   laxmi/laxmi 


suresh> 
create table employee(eid number(3),ename varchar2(10),esal number(10,2));
insert into employee values(401,'Nancy',10000);
insert into employee values(402,'Lucy',20000);
insert into employee values(403,'Kelly',30000);
commit;
select * from employee;


suresh> grant select on employee to laxmi;

laxmi>  select * from suresh.employee;

laxmi> delete from suresh.employee; // insufficient privilege

suresh> grant delete,update on employee to laxmi;

laxmi> 
delete from suresh.employee;
commit;


suresh> select * from employee; //no rows selected

suresh> revoke select,update,delete on employee from laxmi; 


laxmi> disc  

suresh> disc 

DBA> revoke connect,resource from laxmi,suresh;

laxmi> conn  laxmi/laxmi  // logon denied 

suresh>  conn suresh/suresh // logon denied

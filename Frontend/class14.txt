JavaScript
==========

Q)What is the difference between Java and JavaScript?

Java					JavaScript
-------					-----------
It is a non-scripting language.		It is a scripting language.
					(we don't need to compile the program)

We can run individually.		We can't run individually.

It does not required browser window 	It requires browser window for execution.

It is a object oriented programming 	It is a object based programming 
language.				language.

It is a strongly typed checking 	It is a loosely typed checking language.
language.

It is complex language.			It is easy language compare to java.


JavaScript
==============
Javascript is a weakly typed checking language.

The original name of javascript is LiveScript.

LiveScript was developed by Netscape Corporation in 1990's.

In 1995, The Brenden Eich popular scientist of Netscape corporation renamed LiveScript to JavaScript. 

The official name of javascript is ECMA script.

Here ECMA means European Company Manufacturer Assocation. 

Javascript is developed by using C language syntax's.

Advantages of JavaScript
=======================
It is used to developed interactive web pages.

It is used to perform client side form validations.

It is used to display dialog boxes and popup boxes.

It is used to create responsive(Dynamic) design.

It supports Drop-Down menu.

It supports objects like Arrays,Strings,RegEx and etc.

It supports Date and Time.

It supports Cookies.

syntax
=========

<script  type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
	stmt1;
	stmt2;
	stmt3;
</script>

ex:1
------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
-----
	Here "type" and "language" attributes are optional to declare.

	Here declaration of semicolon is optional because javascript is a loosely
	typed checking language.

ex:2
------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class")
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:3
-------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.write("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			document.write("This is ihub talent management");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

To bring the space after each statement we need to use document.writeln() stmt.

ex:4
-------

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			document.writeln("This is ihub talent management");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

To bring the new line we need to use <br> tag.

ex:5
------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			<br>
			document.writeln("This is ihub talent management");
		</script>
</body>
</html>
Note:
------
We can't write markup language directly inside script language.
To use markup language inside script language we need to add below logic.

ex:6
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("Welcome to JavaScript class");
			document.writeln("<br>");
			document.writeln("This is ihub talent management");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

It is possible to declare html tags and css properties inside script tag.

ex:7
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
	document.writeln("<h1 style='color:blue'>Welcome to JavaScript class</h1>");
	document.writeln("<br>");
     document.writeln("<h1 style='color:red'>This is ihub talent management</h1>");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Any language which contains HTML, CSS and Javascript is called DHTML (Dynamic Hypertext Markup Language).


Q)Types of Javascript ?

We have two types of javascript.

1)Internal Javascript / Embedded Javascript 

2)External Javascript / Seperate Javascript 


1)Internal Javascript
----------------------
In internal javascript , we will declare html code and javascript code in a single ".html" file.

Advantages:

> We can understand html code and javascript code easily.

> There is no confusion of multiple files.

Disadvantages:

> If code is increases then it will increase complexcity of a programmer.

index.html
-----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("<h1 >Welcome to JavaScript class</h1>");
			document.writeln("<br>");
			document.writeln("<h1>This is ihub talent management</h1>");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Note:
----
	Internal javascript is recommanded for practicing level.


2)External Javascript 
-----------------------
In external javascript, we can maintain HTML code in ".html" file  and javascript code in ".js" file seperately.

We can't execute .js file directly to the browser window.

Advantages:

> We can maintain HTML code and Javascript code seperately.

> If code is increases then it will not increase complexcity of the programmer.

Disadvantages:

> There is a confusion of multipe files.

Note:
----
	External javascript is recommanded for industry level.


Javascript Engine
===================
Javascript engine is responsible to execute javascript code on browser window.

Javascript engine is used to convert user understandable scripting language to machine understandable scripting language.

By default, every browser contains javascript engine.

We have following list of javascript engines.

ex:
	Browser 		JavaScript Engine
	-------------		---------------
	Chrome			V8 Engine	
	firefox			spidermonkey 
	safari			javascriptcore 				
	edge			chakra
	and etc.


JavaScript comments
=====================
Javascript comments are used for documentation purpose.

Using comments we can understand javascript code.

Javascript engine will not display the comments in output.

We have two types of javascript comments.

1)Single line comment
-----------------
	It is used to comment a single line.
	ex:
		// code here 

2)Multiple line comment 
----------------------
	It is used to comment a single line as well as multiple lines.
	It is more convenient when compare to single line comment.
	ex:
		/*
			-
			- code here 
			-
		*/

Output statements in javascript
=================================
Output statements are used to display custom messages and output on browser window.

We have two types of output statements in javascript.

1)document.writeln()

2)console.log() 

1)document.writeln()
--------------------
It is used to display the output on browser window.

ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			document.writeln("I love JavaScript");
		</script>
</body>
</html>


2)console.log() 
--------------
It is used to display the output on browser console then we need to use 
console.log().

ex:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			console.log("I love JavaScript");
		</script>
</body>
</html>

Types of variables in javascript
=================================
A name which is given to a memory location is called variable.

Purpose of variable is used to store the data.

In javascript , a variable is also known as identifier.

We have same rules for javascript variables as we have for identifiers.

Rule1:
--------
A javascript variable must and should starts with alphabet,underscore or dollar symbol.
ex:
	_=10;
	$=20;
	abcd=30;

Rule2:
-----
After first alphabet it can have any number of digits.
ex:
	a1234;  //valid 


Rule3:
-----
Every identifier is a case sensitive.
ex:
	a=10;
	A=10;

In javascript variables are divided into two types.

1)Local variable

2)Global variable 

1)Local variable
----------------
If we declare any variable inside a block or a function is called local variable.

We can access local variable within the block or function only.

ex:1
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			function f1()
			{
				var i=10;
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			function f1()
			{
				var i=10;
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

2)Global variable 
----------------
If we declare any variable outside a block or a function is called global variable.

We can access global variable within the block or function or outside of the block or function.


ex:1
------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			var i=100;
			
			function f1()
			{
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			
			//call the function
			f1();
			
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			var i=100;

			function f1()
			{
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

We can declare a global variable inside the function as well as outside of the function  by using "window" object.

ex:1
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			

			function f1()
			{
				window.i=200;
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

ex:2
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>MyPage!</title>
</head>
<body>
		<script>
			
			window.i=200;
			function f1()
			{
				window.i=200;
				document.writeln(i);	
			}
			function f2()
			{
				document.writeln(i);
			}
			//call the function
			f1();
			f2();
		</script>
</body>
</html>

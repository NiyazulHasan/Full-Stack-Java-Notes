Spring Security
=============
Spring Security is a framework which provides various security features like  authentication, authorization to create secure Java Enterprise Applications.

It is a sub-project of Spring framework which was started in 2003 by Ben Alex.

Later on, in 2004, It was released under the Apache License as Spring Security 2.0.0.

This framework targets two major areas of application i.e authentication and authorization. 

Authentication 
---------------------
It is a process of knowing and identifying the user that wants to access.

Authorization 
---------------------
It is a process to allow authority to perform actions in the application.

We can apply authorization to authorize web request, methods and access to individual domain.

Spring Security framework supports wide range of authentication models. 

These models either provided by third parties or framework itself.

@RestController
public class MyController {

	@GetMapping("/msg")
	public String msg()
	{
		return "Welcome to Spring Security";
	}
}

step3:
--------
	Configure server port number in application.properties file.
application.properties
-----------------------------
server.port=9191


step4:
----------

step6:
----------
	Test the application by using below url.

spring.security.user.name=raja
spring.security.user.password=rani
